# PillowDude
Let's settle this down peacefully, alright ?

## What's PillowDude?
PillowDude is a Discord bot that helps in arguments and serious discussion,
using a priority pillow (Basically a token). When someone have the pillow, he is
the [priority Speaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL8VO-oxuAY). When he
finished talking, he release the pillow, and the next in the queue (or if
nobody is in the queue, return to a neutral state)
